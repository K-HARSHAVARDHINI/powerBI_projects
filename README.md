# powerBI_projects


During my internship at Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd, I gained hands-on experience with ETL processes using Python and honed my skills in data analysis and visualization with tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. I worked extensively with diverse datasets from e-commerce and domain sales, uncovering key metrics and trends to drive insights. My responsibilities included creating interactive dashboards, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and developing expertise in statistical analysis, data cleaning, and data manipulation, all while maintaining a strong focus on data integrity and privacy.
